        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

         <p>I have a lot of interesting hobbies in my leisure time. Although it may create an illusion about "not spending enough time on research", I still insist on high productivity 
           as opposed to facing with screen all day and receiving nothing except an exhausted body.</p>
          <p>Here is some adrenalin helps me to keep buoyancy and bravity to overcome unkown incidents.</p>
          <b>Sports</b> 
       <p><i>Outdoors</i>: Hiking, Mountaineering, Cycling<br>
          <i>Indoors</i>: Workout, Badminton, Running on a treadmill<br>
        <small>Carving body is one of rare things yield positive feedback after putting time and effort.<br>
          Now my fitness schedule is: strength training (7 days/week) and cardio (4 days/week).</small></p>
        
        <p><b>Photography</b><br>
          Camera is the greatest invention! The memory will decay as time goes, but that moment and feeling will be saved in pictures-espeacially I love to write anything in my diary.
          Once words match pictures, I can even hear the echoes from the mountain!<br>
          If we strictly talk about artistic photography, I'm leaning towards landscape photography, particularly snow mountains. 
          The lattest picture is the adorable Baby Canada Geese-they can be easily seen at UW, don't come too close!
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Travel</b><br>
          For those who love hiking and photography then they couldn't be possible fleeing from travelling. I'm open to any travel styles, here are some of my flashbacks:
           <ul>
          <li>Traveled as a backpacker in Yunnan for 12 days alone<br>
           <small>One 25-km-hiking from airport to a spot with my phone flashlight from 2am to 7am for sunrise photography</small></li>
          <li>More than 90 hours green train round trip on hard seat to Tibet<br>
           <small>Awesome view and the best experience to talk with the locals!</small></li>
<!--              A Tibetan woman shared with me the home-made yak jerky, so chewy but tasty! -->
          <li>A wild road trip with one friend in Xinjiang to celebrate our grduation<br>
           <small>We two drove for 3185km, experienced thunderstorm, mudslide and the spectacular setting sun where we slept in the meadow, tent and the car</small></li>
          <li>Landed in Vancouver for 5 days travel before going to Waterloo<br>
           <small>Dragging 3 heavy suitcases in the prosperous Vancouver downtown is so hilarious!</small></li>
           </ul>
        </p>
        
        <b>Music</b>
           <ol>
          <li>
            floaty and gentle R&B
          </li>
          <li>rhythmed drunmbeat dance music</li>
        </ol>
         <p><b>Cooking</b><br>
        I have learned cooking from my mom, she can make superb desserts and different cuisines (Her steamed perch is AMAZING!)
        I love mixing "crazy" food, like mashed banana, diced chicken and fried rice-It's actually quite good.
        Exercise serves with eatting more:) 
        My favorite dishes are stew beef, deep-fried chicken and salmon fried rice. </p>
        <p><b>Literary Reading and Writing</b><br>
          I'm so ashamed for long time not reading literary books, although I still spend some time on criticism videos. Chinese Prose is my favorite.

<!--         <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p> -->

        <p>I’m a 2nd-year Master student advised by Prof. <a href="https://michaelwfisher.github.io/">Michael W. Fisher</a> in the Dynamics, Control, and Optimization of Complex Systems (DOCS) Group at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>. 
         Prior to joining UW, I got my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/">Wuhan University</a>. Recently, my work focused on</p>

<p>Today, with the explosion of data, more and more people are in desperate need to access and make use of data in more and more fields, 
  such as social science and healthcare. However, both domain-specific and programming skills are required for an individual to do so, but not everyone has the background. 
  Inspired by such use cases, my current research focuses on developing methods to help users interact with and make sense of data using machine learning and programming language techniques.</p>

        <p>You can find my hopefully-up-to-date CV here.</p>

        <h2>Presentation</h2>

        <p>Here is my graduate course presentation.</p>

        <p>ECE 686:</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>
       

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

         <p>I have a lot of interesting hobbies in my leisure time. Although it may create an illusion about "not spending enough time on research", I still insist on high productivity 
           as opposed to facing with screen all day and receiving nothing except an exhausted body.</p>
          <p>Here is some adrenalin helps me to keep buoyancy and bravity to overcome unkown incidents.</p>
          <b>Sports</b> 
       <p><i>Outdoors</i>: Hiking, Mountaineering, Cycling<br>
          <i>Indoors</i>: Workout, Badminton, Running on a treadmill<br>
        <small>I have went to gym since I come to Canada, while the systematic workout has been executed from March 2024. 
          Now my fitness schedule is: strength training (7 days/week) and cardio (4 days/week).</small></p>
        
        <p><b>Photography</b><br>
          Camera is the greatest invention! The memory will decay as time goes, but that moment and feeling will be saved in pictures-espeacially I love to write anything in my diary.
          Once words match pictures, I can even hear the echoes from the mountain!<br>
          If we strictly talk about artistic photography, I'm leaning towards landscape photography, particularly snow mountains. 
          The lattest picture is the adorable Baby Canada Goose-they are easily seen at UW, don't come too close!
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Travel</b><br>
          For those who love hiking and photography then they couldn't be possible fleeing from travelling. I'm open to any travel styles, here are some of my flashbacks:<br>
           <ul>
          <li>Traveled as a backpacker in Yunnan for 12 days alone<br>
           <small>One 25-km-hiking from airport to a spot with my phone flashlight from 2am to 7am for sunrise photography</small></li>
          <li>Took more than 90 hours green train round trip on hard seat to Tibet and Xinjiang<br>
           <small>Awesome view and the best experience to talk with the locals! A Tibetan woman shared with me the home-made yak jerky, so chewy but tasty!</small></li>
          <li>Schemed a wild road trip with one friend in Xinjiang to celebrate our grduation of Bachelor<br>
           <small>We two drove for 3185km, experienced thunderstorm, mudslide and the spectacular setting sun where we slept in the meadow, tent and the car</small></li>
          <li>Landed in Vancouver for 5 days travel before going to Waterloo<br>
           <small>Dragging 3 heavy suitcases in the prosperous Vancouver downtown is so hilarious!</small></li>
        </ul>
        
        </p>
        <b>Music</b>
           <ol>
          <li>
            floaty and gentle R&B
          </li>
          <li>rhythmed drunmbeat dance music</li>
        </ol>
         <p><b>Cooking</b><br>
        I have learned cooking from my mom, she can make a lot of superb breads, pastries (Her steamed perch is AMAZING!)
        I love mixing some "crazy" food, like mashed banana, diced chicken and fried rice (actually try this, it's really good.) 
        
        My favorite dishes are stew beef, deep-fried chicken and salmon fried rice. </p>
        <p><b>Literary Reading and Writing</b><br>
          I'm so ashamed for long time not reading literary books, although I still spend some time on criticism videos. Chinese Prose is my favorite.
